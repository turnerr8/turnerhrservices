                Turner HR Services has been a valued asset for Whatcom County. Kara was instrumental in the recruitment and hiring of several of our Directors, has been a respected trainer for our Certified Public Official program, and has volunteered on the County Elected Official Salary Commission.  I find Kara to be fair, efficient, and knowledgeable.

                As hard as it was to accept that a tiny company like mine needs an Employee Handbook, it has earned its worth several times over.  When in doubt, we go to the handbook and get a definitive answer and this happens a lot more than I would have ever thought.  It takes all the pressure off of me, the owner, from having to make on the spot subjective policy decisions.  Every business should have one!

                    I’ve worked with Turner HR Services for over 10 years.  Kara’s attention to detail, her approach towards aligning company values with professional Human Resources services and her commitment to excellence were invaluable to our organization (Emergency Reporting).  She displayed the ability to scale her services with our company growth strategy, and continued to deliver the highest quality HR services in the region.

                Kara is a highly effective and professional HR leader who has a keen ability to build a positive rapport and intuit the ideas of elected officials, nonprofit leaders and staff. She is able to build trust and guide organizations to implement HR policy and procedures that enhance the workplace experience. I recommend Kara to any organization seeking to strengthen their HR functions.
