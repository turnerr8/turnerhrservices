                Turner HR Services has been a valued asset for Whatcom County. Kara was instrumental in the recruitment and
                 hiring of our Public Works Director, has been a respected trainer for our Certified Public Official program,
                  and has volunteered on the County Elected Official Salary Commission.
                    I find Kara to be fair, efficient, and knowledgeable.

                As hard as it was to accept that a tiny company like mine needs a 50+ page employee manual,
                 it has earned its worth several times over.  When in doubt, we go to the handbook and get a definitive answer
                  and this happens a lot more than I would have ever thought.  It takes all the pressure off of me,
                   the owner, from having to make on the spot subjective policy decisions.  Every business should have one!
